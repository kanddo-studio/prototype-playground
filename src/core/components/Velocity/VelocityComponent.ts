 * Component that stores an entity's base movement speed.

 * - Serve as a plain data container for movement speed used by MovementSystem.
 * - Provide small, intention-revealing helpers (set, reset, clone).
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - This component should NOT contain actual velocity vectors (x/y) â€” those belong in DesiredVelocityComponent.
 * - Keep this component small and serializable for debugging and snapshotting.
 * - Speed is typically in units per second (but depends on how your systems interpret it).
